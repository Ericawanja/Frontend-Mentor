## Features and Tools

1. ReactJs

ReactJs is a front-end library for building user interfaces that uses component based approach. Besides implementing basic reactJs feautures such as Fuctional components and props, in this project have implemented Routing, Hooks such as UseState, UseEffect, and Refs.


2. React-router-dom

With the increased popularity of single-page-application because of the reduced loading time and fewer server calls, **React-router** is a library that makes possible to build several pages  as single page application in reactJs.

React router allows you to define different routes which are handled dynamically under one tree. Check more about react router [here](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) 

3. Used styled-components

**Styled components** is a popular modern ReactJs library that allows you to build custom components by writing actual CSS in Javascript.
Advantages of using styled-components are:

- **Automatic critical Css** which keeps track of rendered component and injects the required CSS only. Hence, only the necessary page code loaded which reduces the loading time.
- **Painless maintenance** All the styles of a particular component are within one code block and file making maintenance easy even on Large codebases.
- **Simple dynamic styling** Ability to style the components based on the passed props makes it easy to dynamically change the styles.
- Those are features of styled components that I used in this project. More about styled components can be found [here](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#motivation).

4. Framer motion api

This is a production-ready library optimized for React. [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/introduction/) is a simple but powerful package that makes it easy to express complex user interactions with robust semantic markup.

5. Js Doc

USed JsDoc to document the various type of function parameters. Good code documentation helps to understand what a particular code snippet does in future, and easy time to the maintenance team
